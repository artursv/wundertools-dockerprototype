------ INIT COMPLETE ------------

Drupal 8 has been built into the curent path, and
a new wundertools.settings.inc file has been added
which you can modify to alter your system.

Wundertools now expects your source code to be in
the /app path, next to the wundertools folder.

If you have a custom docker-compose.yml file, you
can add it the project root, next to the wundertools
folder.  If you want to create one, you can start
with the composer-default.yml file in the wundertools
folder, but try to remove the shell variables from it.

The initial composer actions have been run, so you
should be able to get started using:

    $/> wundertools up
